# dendro_functions

A set of functions for tree-ring analysis.


The [:file\_folder: R](/R) directory contains the R-script for each function.

## `CorrTable`

Computes correlations between a set of tree-ring series `x` (class 'rwl', see `dplR`: https://github.com/AndyBunn/dplR) and dated reference chronologies `y`.

When only one set of tree-ring series is provided, internal correlations are computed.

```{r eval=F}

CorrTable(x,
          y = NULL,
          min_overlap = 30,
          remove.duplicates = TRUE,
          output = "table", #c("matrix", "table") a list of matrices for each correlation variable, or a single table as output
          values = c("r_pearson", "t_St", "glk", "glk_p", "tBP", "tHo"), # for selecting a reduced set of correlation variables
          sort_by = "tHo") #c("glk", "t_St", "tBP", "tHo", "r_pearson")) sorting variable when "table" is chosen as output

```

**Output values:**

- overlap: n° of shared years between two series
- glk: the *Gleichlaüfigkeit* or percentage of parallel variation (%PV)
- glk_p: the probability of exceedence for the *Gleichläufigkeit* value
- tBP: *t*-values according to the Baillie-Pilcher (1973) algorithm
- tHo: *t*-values according to the Hollstein (1980) algorithm
- r_pearson:  Pearson correlation between two series
- t_St: Student's *t*-value of the Pearson correlation
