# dendro_functions

A set of functions for tree-ring analysis.


The [:file\_folder: R](/R) directory contains the R-script for each function.

## `CorrTable`

Computes correlations between a set of tree-ring series (class 'rwl', see `dplR`: https://github.com/AndyBunn/dplR) and dated reference chronologies (class 'rwl', see `dplR`: https://github.com/AndyBunn/dplR).

When only one set of tree-ring series is provided, internal correlations are computed.


**Output values:**

- overlap: n° of shared years between two series
- glk: the *Gleichlaüfigkeit* or percentage of parallel variation (%PV)
- glk_p: the probability of exceedence for the *Gleichläufigkeit* value
- tBP: *t*-values according to the Baillie-Pilcher algorithm
- tHo: *t*-values accoriding to the Hollstein 1980 algorithm
- r_pearson:  Pearson correlation between two series
- t_St: Student's *t*-value of the Pearson correlation
