# dendro_functions

A set of functions for tree-ring analysis.

## `CorrTable`

Computes correlations between two sets of tree-ring series (class 'rwl', see `dplR`). When only one set of trs is provided, internal correlations are computed.

Output values:

- overlap: n° of shared years between two series
- glk: the *Gleichlaüfigkeit* or percentage of parallel variation (%PV)
- tBP: t-values according to the Baillie-Pilcher algorithm
- tHo: t-values accoriding to the Hollstein 1980 algorithm
- r_pearson:  Pearson correlation between two series
